Writing Day
===========

What is Writing Day? 
--------------------

Writing Day is modeled after the concept of "sprints" or “hackathons”, which are common in open-source (OSS) conferences. 

Held on Sunday, the first day of the conference, attendees are encouraged to bring a project or contribute to someone else’s project. 

The main goal is to get interesting people in the same room, sharing their passion and goals and collaborating to find creative solutions to solve a problem or issue.

Attendees are invited to submit their project pre-conference! It's a great way to get other attendees excited about contributing. We'll open project submissions in February/March.

**There are two main types of Writing Day attendees:**

- Project leads: Attendees bringing ideas, content, or OSS projects to work on with contributors.
- Contributors: Attendees looking to contribute to various content projects.

**Here are some examples of projects that you might see at the conference:**

-  Open-source software documentation
-  General documentation writing
-  Best practices manual (for your company, or the world)
-  Resume, cover letter, and portfolio reviews
-  Blog posts
-  Tips and tricks
-  Great works of fiction
-  Love letters
-  The Documentarian Manifesto

Lead a Project
--------------

Leading a project at Writing Day is a wonderful opportunity to engage with documentarians from a variety of backgrounds, experience, and expertise. Their collective wealth of experience can help upgrade your documentation and create a more inclusive project. This empowers all of us to work together to create opportunities for each other and bigger, better communities.


**Tips to create and lead a new project effectively:** 

-  **Provide a project overview with a specific focus or goals:** Your project overview is a 2 minute pitch that describes your project and clearly defines a focus area or goal. Here’s a good example from Writing Day 2022, the `Open Web Docs project <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2022/writing-day/#open-web-docs>`_.
-  **Pre-label tasks and issues:** Create a specific event label and label documentation tasks and issues. This empowers new contributors to find tasks that interest them.
-  **Create a task filter:** This  helps contributors find issues more easily and see which issues have been assigned.
-  **Clear onboarding:** Ensure your ReadMe, contribution guidelines, or onboarding instructions are accurate and up to date.
-  **Submit your Writing Day Project:** Adding your project to the Writing Day project list promotes your project to our attendees before the event. Many attendees have told us that their curiosity about certain projects incentivised their attendance.
-  **Project Experts:** We recommend having 1-2 project experts on your project. We love our developer advocates, community managers, and subject matter experts! You’re welcome to call for virtual reinforcements from your community as well.
-  **Flexibility and Understanding:** Reminder that attendees may need additional info to be successful in onboarding to your project.

These are suggestions and not requirements. It is perfectly valid to show up to Writing Day, tell us about your project day of, and ask for volunteers! It’s been done before and it will be done again.

Contribute to a Project
-----------------------

Writing Day is the perfect opportunity to learn about new projects and technologies. Some attendees stay at one table all day, others table hop. Do what feels right to you.

Check out the project list! Keep in mind that some attendees choose to announce their projects during Writing Day and the information is not available on the project list.

**Tips to contribute to a project:**

-  **No matter your experience level, you are welcome!** We are glad you’re here. Even if you `feel <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome>`__ as though you don't have the right skills or experience or have never attended an event like Writing Day before, you’ll be surprised how much you can share.
-  **Check out our guide to writing documentation.** Our `beginners guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/>`_ will help you get started, and give you some ideas for how you can contribute to a project.
-  **Ask people for help if you have a question.** If at any time you get stuck with new concepts and tools, you are in a room full of friendly people from diverse backgrounds and experiences.  If you are not sure who to ask, ask the Welcome Wagon or Registration staff or volunteers. We will help you find someone!

Submit Your Project
-------------------

We encourage you to submit a Writing Day project in advance! We'll open project submissions in February/March. **Projects submitted by April 5 are promoted in our pre-conference Writing Day blog post and email.**

Walk-on projects are always welcome. You always have the option to bring your project, sign up on site, and announce it during Writing Day.
