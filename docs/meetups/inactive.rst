Archived or inactive groups
===========================

We wanted to list inactive and archived Write the Docs groups to acknowledge all of the hard work
organizers and volunteers.

Groups are categorized as paused, inactive, or archived:

* **Paused groups**: A group or program that is on hiatus
* **Inactive groups**: A group that is still listed on Meetup.com but has not hosted an event in 12+ months
* **Archived groups**: A group that has been removed\* from Meetup.com

\* Archived groups may include a group that is in the process of being removed from Meetup.com.
